# readable-reactnd-project

An application built using React + Redux. This application follows the content and comment structure that is common throughout a large amount of websites and applications. I decided to model the styling similar to that of the dark themed reddit app.


# API Server

To install and start the API server, cd into the api-server directory and run the following commands:

* `npm install`__
or
* `yarn`__
then
* `node server`

#Front-End

After starting the API server, cd into the front-end directory and run the following commands:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`__
or
* `yarn`
* `yarn start`
